            <h1>Why It Works</h1>
                <p><span>The above system</span> is designed to drive a persistent rise in the value of the $EXO token. Firstly, the pegged price serves as a ‘price floor’, below which a significant portion of exchange fees are diverted to buyback and burn of $EXO tokens. Combined with the reduced token minting rates whilst under peg, this mechanism serves to create a powerful deflationary effect which will restore $EXO to above its pegged price. As the pegged price rises, token emission rates are lowered in such a way to ensure that token scarcity increases while also ensuring that the overall value of staking rewards continues to rise along with the token price.</p>

                <p><span>Because this pegged price</span> is programmed to rise over time, this then results in a token with an ever-increasing price floor, pushing the price up consistently over time. This also creates an even greater incentive for holders of <span> $EXO</span> to trade using our platform, since a portion of the exchange fees go directly to boosting the value of their $EXO holdings.</p>
                <p><span>Furthermore</span>, this is achieved in a sustainable way, because it does so using externally-generated income in the form of fees paid by users of exoSwap and other exo-branded utilities. Unlike many DeFi projects - which rely on pyramid-style tokenomics - $EXO is not reliant on new buyers coming in to maintain its pegged price because it does so using profits from fees paid by users of our products - even those who have never bought or held a single $EXO token. 
                </p>
                <p><span>At the time of writing,</span> this is a market-first mechanism not employed by any other decentralized swap platform. In conjunction with the fact that $EXO is, first and foremost, a utility token required in order to access our suite of unique features (and therefore comes with huge built-in demand), this creates a token that offers ongoing upside to investors regardless of how early they buy.

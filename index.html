                                Exo.fi represents the next generation of DeFi cross-chain swap infrastructure, a community-oriented project changing the way cryptocurrency is traded and placing previously unseen levels of control and flexibility in the hands of project dev teams. The $EXO token - around which all exo.fi utilities are built - unlocks features across the platform and makes every holder into an exo.fi shareholder, earning them a share of profits from every utility and enabling voting rights on community governance issues. Unique appreciating-pegged tokenomics meanwhile create an ever-increasing price floor for the $EXO token, supported by income generated from fees.
                            </p>
                            <p><span style=""><strong>Alongside the swap platform is exoStart</strong></span>, an incubator service allowing projects to launch on the chain of their choice - either with or without a presale - and featuring novel anti-dump functionality to prevent market manipulation by large presale buyers after launch. exoTools, meanwhile, is a suite of utilities for cryptocurrency projects, including the already-completed exoTools TG bot that allows teams brand new functionality designed to enable greater community engagement than seen previously.

                    <h1>Exo Swap</h1>
                    <h2>The headline offering of the exo.fi project is exoSwap, a multi-chain decentralized exchange designed to allow cryptocurrency developers the power to control how their token is traded.</h2>
                    
                    <div class="row">

                                <p>
                                    Where previously such features would have to be coded into a token’s smart contract, exoSwap now allows developers to set custom trading fees direct on the swap platform itself, allocating them to various uses such as liquidity, lotteries, staking, burns, dev wallet and more - allowing young projects the ability to generate income to support themselves in the critical early days without selling off their own tokens and impacting price. Furthermore, developers can make use of anti-dump mechanisms to limit the ability of whales to manipulate the price, and can create LP farms/staking pools funded either by their own token, or using funds generated from the custom fee feature, or both. 
            
                                </p>
                                <p><span>$EXO token holders,</span> meanwhile, will receive a permanent share of all trading fees generated by the platform by staking their tokens, with control over the amounts and allocation of trading fees eventually transitioning to a community-governed model. All traders, meanwhile, will receive lottery tickets for every $1 traded on the platform, offering them the chance to win a huge jackpot (as well as other prizes) simply for trading on our exchange. </p>

                  <span>  ExoLock</span> is our innovative, <span>NFT-based flexible</span> token locking system. Tokens can be locked for a specified period - as with existing token locking services - however with exoLock, the locked funds are represented by an NFT, meaning control of the funds can be transferred to another owner simply by sending the NFTto the new wallet address.  <span> This allows‘vested’ payments </span>   to third parties such as influencers, where tokens are transferred but not available to dump on the market for a set period.
                </p>
                <p><span>Where exoLock’s real game changing utility</span> comes in is when used for locking liquidity. For the first time ever, project developers will be able to access a portion of their token’s locked liquidity for set pre-approved uses either by community governance voting, or by meeting predefined minimum liquidity requirements. Tokens with sufficient liquidity (or where the community votes to approve it) can transfer part of their liquidity to a pre-approved market-making service, for use on one or more <span>CEX platforms</span> . The team can even apply to use some of the liquidity to assist with the CEX listing fee itself (subject to a vote) or make a custom proposal (for example, for a specific marketing service) for their holders to vote on, executed via the exoMarket/escrow services.</p>

                <p><span style="text-align: center;">Trading liquidity is an asset that belongs to all holders of that token - exoLock allows the community to leverage that asset to support the growth of their project.</span>

Pre-audited token contracts will be available to further reduce the technical barriers to entry, and a portion of launchpad fees will be added to the incubator fund. Periodically, projects will be able to apply for incubation packages, including funding, promotion on exo.fi socials and advertising space across all platforms, which will be awarded via $EXO community governance voting. On launch, dev teams can set temporary trading fees and enable anti-dump mechanisms, such as rate-limited token release for those who bought in the presale.

                    </h1>
                    <p>The umbrella name for a variety of exo-branded utilities, exoTools products are aimed at offering novel functionality to project developers and enabling greater community engagement in the cryptocurrency space. The flagship exoToolsBot performs all the functions expected of a TG bot - charts, prices, project info and more - but adds in a market-first wallet-to-ID mapping service called walletLink, enabling holders to associate one or more wallet addresses to their Telegram ID, Twitter handle and more. In conjunction with exoSwap’s lottery function, projects can host giveaways amongst all their holders, with the winners announced via their actual usernames. A tipping service will also feature, to allow holders to show appreciation to helpful community members. </p>
                    <p>exoToolsBot can also be interacted with outside of a project telegram channel. If a user has set up walletLink, exotoolsBot can provide price alerts, wallet balance tracking and other useful information directly. Furthermore, the bot allows tokens to incorporate community governance elements even if their token contract does not allow it - for example, on setting custom trading fees on the DEX.</p>
                    <p>
                        exoConnect is an upcoming utility that will enable new DeFi startups to plug directly into exoSwap, and have a custom-branded swap platform of their own using exoSwap liquidity, with all the functionality available on the main exoSwap exchange. This removes the need for projects to undertake costly and time-intensive forks, providing a simple and secure alternative that makes new projects into partners rather than competitors. This community-oriented approach is reinforced by the fact that a token listed on exoSwap or any exoConnect-powered DEX is also available to trade on every other partner DEX too, meaning that as one platform grows, all partners grow too.
